# Comparison of Different Shells

## What is a Shell?
A **shell** is a command-line interface (CLI) that allows users to interact with the operating system by executing commands. It acts as a bridge between the user and the OS kernel.

## Comparison of Common Shells

| Shell              | Platform         | Use Cases                          | Scripting Support | Command Syntax         | Power & Control          |
|-------------------|------------------|------------------------------------|-------------------|------------------------|---------------------------|
| **CMD**           | Windows          | Basic file management, system tasks | Minimal           | Windows-specific       | Low to Medium             |
| **PowerShell**    | Windows, Cross-platform | Advanced system admin, scripting | High              | Verb-Noun style (`Get-Process`) | Very High                |
| **Bash**          | Linux, macOS, WSL | Most Linux tasks, scripting        | High              | UNIX-like (`ls`, `grep`) | High                      |
| **Anaconda Prompt** | Windows (Python users) | Running Python in conda envs     | Python & shell mix | Similar to CMD + Conda  | Medium                    |
| **Zsh** (Bonus)   | Linux, macOS     | Custom shell with themes/plugins   | High              | Bash-compatible        | High + User-Friendly      |

## Key Differences

- **PowerShell** is object-based, while **CMD** and **Bash** are text-based.
- **CMD** is outdated for modern scripting; **PowerShell** replaces it.
- **Bash** is the default on most Linux distros and widely used in servers.
- **Anaconda Prompt** is CMD under the hood but preloaded with Python environments.
- **Zsh** offers autocomplete, plugins (Oh My Zsh), and better user experience.
